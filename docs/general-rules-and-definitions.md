# General rules & definitions

## Time to market (product startup company)
Sometimes you have to more focus on features than best practices. Such a situation may occur at the initial stage of building a startup.
You can create the best e2e, integration, and unit tests to increase the reliability of the application but the startup could fail due to a long time to market. 

üèÜ Is important to pay the technical debt in the future!

## Technical debt

### What is a technical debt?
*Technical Debt is a metaphor, so the real question is whether or not the debt metaphor is helpful about thinking about how to deal with design problems, and how to communicate that thinking.* [Martin Fowler](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TechnicalDebt.html).

### Definition
Everyone can have their definition of technical debt so it is important to discuss and unify it in your environment.

The definition that I use and highly recommend it. üëá
```
[The architecture we would like to have] - [current architecture] = [technical debt]
```
This is not a whim! "Would like to have" is based on our knowledge and experience.
Architecture is broad topic but let me give you a few examples:
- quality of the code
- tests
- documentation
- databases
- observability
- design patterns
- dependencies
- and more ...

Try to imagine a situation when your team selects MySQL to persistent data in your small application. Based on your team's experience this database is a great choice. Time flies and the scale of the application grows. After this time due to the performance issues is a better choice to use MongoDB (document database). How do you want to communicate to business this problem? This example is technical debt or not? Using the definition I use the answer is simple it is technical debt.

### Scenarios of arises technical debt
- long time life cycle of development and maintenance (for example, technologies become deprecated)
- short term approach
- willingness to provide a solution faster
- lack of domain knowledge
- lack of technical knowledge

### What causes non-payment of debt?
- increased risk an error occurs
- more complex and slower application development
- a worse frame of mind for programmers
- the larger threshold in the project

## Sort by string format of the date
When you want to sort out your documents (catalogs, files, pages and so much more) you can start the name with the date [YYYY-MM-DD].

### Why?
This particular format is easy to sort by string (sort by the string is equal to sort by the date which you declare).

### Examples
- [2022-11-06] Refinement
- [2022-11-06] Retro
- [2022-11-06] Microservices training

And you will have the sorted list of the refinements üëç
- [2022-11-20] Refinement
- [2022-11-10] Refinement
- [2022-10-20] Refinement
