## Sort by string format of the date
When you want to sort out your documents (catalogs, files, pages and so much more) you can start the name with the date [YYYY-MM-DD].

### Why?
This particular format is easy to sort by string (sort by the string is equal to sort by the date which you declare).

### Examples
- [2022-11-06] Refinement
- [2022-11-06] Retro
- [2022-11-06] Microservices training

And you will have the sorted list of the refinements üëç
- [2022-11-20] Refinement
- [2022-11-10] Refinement
- [2022-10-20] Refinement
