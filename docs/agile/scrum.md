# Scrum

## Sprint name
Instead of using sprint names like Sprint 1, Sprint 2, and so on try to name 2022 Q4 Sprint 1, 2022 Q4 Sprint 2

### Why?
- It is easier to analyze your work after generated reports for example.
- it is a good practice from a business perspective (easier synchronization and coordination of teams' work)
- We can [sort by string format of the date](/general-rules-and-definitions.md/#sort-by-string-format-of-the-date)

## Refinement
The meeting is where we discuss tasks and estimate them. It is important to have easy to find one source of truth with a list of the refinements.
Refinement list should be [sorted by date](/general-rules-and-definitions.md/#sort-by-string-format-of-the-date).
Furthermore, it is a good practice to have one facilitator who conducts the meeting. Sprint sheriff can play the role of facilitator.

### Good refinement also have
- agenda (preferable descripted issues)
- timebox
- action points
